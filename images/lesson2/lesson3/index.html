        • Why will people come to your site?<br />
        People will come to this Website to learn new skills, grow for their
        future work, develop their favorite hobbies, etc. <br />
        • What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for
        them?<br />
        They will receive a modern review of what is necessary and important to
        learn in this new 2021. I mean, the new technologies and design courses
        that are available (actualized) at this moment. There will also be
        offered hobbies courses, like recipes and blogs with chef channels,
        among others.<br />
        • What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your
        site?<br />
        They can sign up for a class with teammates, and teachers via zoom
        meetings. This could be a great opportunity to grow as an online
        learner, and technical skills they want to improve for any kind of
        situation. This means a Laboral merch situation, hobbies, and advanced
        courses center on the new technologies.<br />
        • What information is necessary to complete any actions your site
        offers?<br />
        It is requiring their personal information to log in and start the
        online courses. <br />
        • Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get
        this information or complete the actions?<br />
        On this site, you could enjoy being an online learner. Most kinds of
        experiences, like mine, didn´t enjoy learning in online courses where
        all the information is available, and you are lost on there. You need a
        learning guide and help for preparing which course is the best for you.
